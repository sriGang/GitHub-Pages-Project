# **About me as a Person**
 - I am Junior Computer Science major studying at UCSD.

 - I am a huge sports fan and enjoy playing basketball.
# About me as a Programmer
 - I have coded in a number of languages including Java, C, C++, etc.
 - I started coding in high school by learning Java.
 - From coding, I have developed a deeper understanding of technology.
 - I am eager to learn more about the Software Engineering Process not just being a "programmer"

One of my favorite coding classes at UCSD: [CSE30](https://catalog.ucsd.edu/courses/CSE.html)
